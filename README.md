CFR[]
=====

CFR[] (CFR Brackets) is an extremely minimal drawing language that
consists of only five simple commands:

- `C`: Change colour.
- `F`: Move forward by one cell and paint the new cell.
- `R`: Rotate right (clockwise) by 45Â°.
- `[`: Begin a repeatable block and continue executing subsequent code.
- `]`: Repeat current repeatable block once more and exit the block.

Note that `]` goes back to the beginning of the current repeatable
block, repeats it once more, and exits the block.  Thus a block
bounded by `[` and `]` behaves like a loop that runs twice before the
block exits.

CFR[] is a strict subset of CFRS[].  CFRS[] has an additional command
named `S` which can be used to make the turtle sleep for a short
duration.  CFR[] does not have the `S` command.  This is the only
difference between CFR[] and CFRS[].  Therefore, for a complete
description of CFR[], see [CFRS[]](https://github.com/susam/cfrs)
instead but disregard any information pertaining to the `S` command.
